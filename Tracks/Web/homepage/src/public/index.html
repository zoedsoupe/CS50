            A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set
            of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming
            languages are used in computer programming to implement
            algorithms.<br />
            Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
            There are programmable machines that use a set of specific
            instructions, rather than general programming languages. <br />Early
            ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first
            probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th
            century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden
            Age.

          <p>
            Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the
            behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player
            pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's
            scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different
            inputs or conditions.<br />Thousands of different programming
            languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
            Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e.,
            as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use
            the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how
            to achieve it).
          </p>
          <p>
            The description of a programming language is usually split into the
            two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some
            languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the
            C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other
            languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is
            treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic
            language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the
            dominant implementation being common.
